``python-paseto``
=================

This is an implementation of `PASETO`_ for the Python programming
language. **Be warned:** this implementation is currently protocol-only
and has not passed a formal security audit. Also keep in mind that the
PASETO spec itself is merely a draft and requires further scrutiny to
qualify as production-ready.
